# HexEmpireMap

Procedurally generated maps for Hex Empire. This program will generate the same map that can be found in game as a static image.

When the program starts up, it will display a randomnly generated map. If you want to change the map, you can click on the button "Random Map" below, which will generate a different map and display it on the screen.

A Hex Empire map contains 4 capital cities, one at each corner, which are displayed with a unique color (red, violet, blue, green). There are a list of cities and ports spread out across the map that the players have to control in order to increase morale.
